            <p>I was born on a deserted island off the coast of northern Siberia. Sounds interesting, but now that I have your attention, the first sentence is not true! I was born, just like any other standard human, in a Hospital. I've lived in Kuwait, India, UK and have now settled down in the US. </p>
            <p>I have a Bachelors in English Literature and a Masters Degree in Business. I started my career at a start-up company that had launched the first ever e-commerce website in the Middle East called kunoozy.com (meaning treasure). After a few years, and several organizations later in Oct 2010, I started work at my first ever true IT organization - UPS. I enjoy working here, the culture is great, and I have enough challenges to keep me motivated. </p>
            <p>In other personal news - I love watching movies, reading books, walking, and hiking - a list of your typical run-of-the-mill things that most people like. I also enjoy photography and image processing as a hobby and at some younger point in life, was passionate about horse-back riding.</p>
